CRISPR is a gene editing technology that allows scientists to make precise changes to DNA. It is based on a natural defense system that bacteria use to protect themselves from viruses. CRISPR has been used to edit the genes of a wide range of organisms, including plants, animals, and humans.

CRISPR is an open source technology, meaning that the tools and protocols are freely available to anyone. This has made CRISPR accessible to scientists in all parts of the world, and it has accelerated the pace of research in gene editing.

To make the proposed genetic engineering changes to plants, you would need to:

1. Identify the genes that you want to edit.
2. Design CRISPR guide RNAs that will target the desired genes.
3. Deliver the CRISPR guide RNAs to the plant cells.
4. Screen the plant cells for successful gene editing.
5. Regenerate whole plants from the edited cells.

This process requires specialized knowledge and equipment, including a laboratory with sterile conditions. It is important to note that gene editing is a complex process, and there is a risk of unintended consequences.

There are a number of companies and organizations that are developing CRISPR-edited crops for agriculture. These companies and organizations have the necessary expertise and resources to conduct gene editing research and develop commercial products.

If you are interested in learning more about CRISPR gene editing, there are a number of resources available online and in libraries. There are also a number of universities and other institutions that offer training courses in CRISPR gene editing.

In conclusion, CRISPR is a powerful gene editing technology that has the potential to revolutionize agriculture and help solve some of the world's most pressing problems. However, CRISPR gene editing is a complex process, and it is important to use it responsibly and carefully consider the ethical implications of its use.
